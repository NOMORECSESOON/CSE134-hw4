    <h3><b>paper</b> <span style="color:rgb(254, 149, 149);font-weight:bold">OUTCOME</span></h3>
    <p>I published a paper about how to apply SRGAN and CNN technology in to CT image when there exist noise in the CT in 2023. This is my first paper that is published.
        <br>It is published in The 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Machine Learning (CONF-SPML 2024)
        <br>The reason we write this paper is that within the domain of Convolutional Neural Networks, there exists no prior application of ESRGAN for the pre-processing of CT images aimed at CNN diagonalization. 
        The quality of CT scan images holds a direct correlation with the precision of diagnoses. Presently employed methods to enhance image quality are antiquated and have yielded less favorable outcomes. 
        Our objective is to amalgamate ESRGAN, renowned for its prowess in enhancing image resolution, with CNN, in pursuit of a more effective and precise diagnostic procedure.
        In this project, we first gather datasets from the internet. And then in order to test if ESRGAN can actually improve the functionality of CNN, we  preprocess images to make images in the dataset blurry. 
        This provides a dataset served for comparison. Later, we will use ESRGAN model from the internet to improve the quality of blurred images and test CNN on both of them for comparison.
        As a result, using Enhanced ESRGAN can help improve the accuracy of detecting whether there is a disease in the CT images.
